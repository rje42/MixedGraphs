\usage{
districts(graph)

un(graph, sort = 1)

neighbourhoods(graph, undirected_only = TRUE)

cliques(graph, sort = 1, max_len)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{\code{mixedgraph} object}

\item{sort}{should output be sorted?  sort=3 will also sort cliques}

\item{undirected_only}{logical: should vertices not adjacent to an 
undirected edge be ignored?}

\item{max_len}{maximum size of clique to consider}
}
\description{
The usual familial relations between vertices in
mixed graphs.
}
\details{
\code{districts} and \code{neighbourhoods} find the
bidirected-connected and undirected-connected components of \code{graph}.
\code{un} finds the undirected part of \code{graph}.

\code{cliques} uses the Bron-Kirbosch algorithm to find 
maximal connected subsets.
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{

\item \code{neighbourhoods}: Obtain neighbourhoods

\item \code{cliques}: Obtain maximal complete undirected subsets
}}
