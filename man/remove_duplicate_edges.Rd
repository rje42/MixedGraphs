\usage{
remove_duplicate_edges(edges, directed = TRUE, sort = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{edges}{something from \code{edgeList} object}

\item{directed}{are edges directed? (i.e.
does the order of vertices matter?)}

\item{sort}{should vertices in undirected edges
be sorted as a side-effect of the function? (list form
only)

Check for and remove duplicate edges in a list of
edges or edgeMatrix.  Note that this will sort 
elements in eList objects.}
